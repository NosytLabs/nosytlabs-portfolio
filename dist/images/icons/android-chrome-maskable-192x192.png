This is a placeholder for the Android Chrome Maskable 192x192 icon.
Please replace this file with an actual 192x192 PNG icon named 'android-chrome-maskable-192x192.png'.

The icon should be a square PNG format image with a size of 192x192 pixels.
Unlike regular icons, maskable icons are designed to fill the entire space
and accommodate various mask shapes used by different Android devices.

Design guidelines for maskable icons:
1. Place your main icon content within a safe zone (about 60% of the total area)
2. The background should extend to the edges of the image
3. Avoid transparent backgrounds - use a solid color that matches your brand

You can use tools like https://maskable.app/ to preview how your icon will appear
with different masks applied.
