This is a placeholder for the Android Chrome 512x512 icon.
Please replace this file with an actual 512x512 PNG icon named 'android-chrome-512x512.png'.

The icon should be a square PNG format image with a size of 512x512 pixels.
This larger icon is used for higher-density screens and OS-level integration
on Android devices.

You can create this icon by resizing your logo to 512x512 pixels and 
ensuring it has a transparent background for better integration with various 
Android themes.
