This is a placeholder for the Android Chrome Maskable 512x512 icon.
Please replace this file with an actual 512x512 PNG icon named 'android-chrome-maskable-512x512.png'.

The icon should be a square PNG format image with a size of 512x512 pixels.
Unlike regular icons, maskable icons are designed to fill the entire space
and accommodate various mask shapes used by different Android devices.

Design guidelines for maskable icons:
1. Place your main icon content within a safe zone (about 60% of the total area)
2. The background should extend to the edges of the image
3. Avoid transparent backgrounds - use a solid color that matches your brand

This larger icon is used for higher-density screens and OS-level integration
on Android devices. You can use tools like https://maskable.app/ to preview 
how your icon will appear with different masks applied.
